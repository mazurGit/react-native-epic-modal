## 🚀 Basic Usage

### 1. Wrap your app with `ModalProvider`

```tsx
import { ModalProvider } from 'react-native-epic-modal';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ModalProvider>
      {/* Your App Content */}
    </ModalProvider>
  );
}
```

---

### 2. Use `Modal` anywhere in your app

```tsx
import { Modal } from 'react-native-epic-modal';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Button, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Screen() {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <>
      <Button title="Open Modal" onPress={() => modalRef.current?.show()} />

      <Modal
        ref={modalRef}
        name="example-modal"
        animation="zoom"
        gestureEnabled
      >
        <Text>Modal Content Here!</Text>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```
